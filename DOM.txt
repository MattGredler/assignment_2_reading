DOM stands for Document Object Model. Your computer uses a programming language called JavaScript to use DOM. There are only two reasons that a website's DOM and the HTML would not be the same; if it is messed with by your computer's javaScript or it's browser's automatic "fixes". These automatic fixes are changes that browsers, like chrome, automatically apply to all webpages that you visit. DOM can change a bunch of things on a webpage; not only how it looks but how it acts. You can use DOM in your browser's console without to modify objects with out changing the original page. You can change colors, layout or anything else that would otherwise require midifying the Cascading Style Sheets that web developers use to make webpages pretty and readable. If you go into your console by pressing F12 you can type Document and it will display the semantic HTML used to for the content of the page.
